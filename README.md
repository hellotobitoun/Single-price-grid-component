# PROCESS AND CHALLENGES [Frontend Mentor Challenge]
## Day 1
This was a great design to work on and it was really challenging. I have just started learning HTML and CSS and how to use Grid and Flexbox properly. I initially tried using display grid for this project but I got stuck, so I switched to flexbox which after designing became a nightmare when I used media query to get the cards to stack one upon the other.

## Day 2
I took a break from it all together and started the project again from scratch, with some help from Kevin Powell's YouTube channel. I wanted to also use custom properties for my CSS values and I was in a hurry the previous day, so I took my time set each style up in my :root and started working up from there. 

I believe the error from the previous code was that I didn't assign the second and thrid cards to the remaining boxes within the grid. I only assigned the first card which was supposed to span across 2 boxes and forgot to assign the rest. So all the variations i created within my media query didn't apply. 

Cleaning up my code the way I did and properly organizing each class into it's respective group helped make my process a lot better in the updated code.
